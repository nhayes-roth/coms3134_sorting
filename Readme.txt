Person.java - Person.java defines a class of objects that represent persons

MakeNames.java - takes two text files (firstNames and lastNames) and writes a list of 1000 people, each with a randomly selected first name and last name, but each with a unique, four-digit identification code.

Sort.java - Sort.java sorts a database of People objects alphabetically. Keeps track of each comparison of Persons, and all swaps. Can use either quicksort or heapSort based on the command line argument and either print the sorted array or the statistics, also based on the command line argument.
